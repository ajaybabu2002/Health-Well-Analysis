# Health-Well-Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Project Overview
I'm thrilled to share the successful completion of a comprehensive data science project focused on a health dataset from a prominent insurance company.
This project was a fusion of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, delving deep into critical factors that influence health insurance outcomes: age, BMI, smoking status, and the number of children.

### Data Scources
Health Well Data: The primary datasets used are 'HealthWell Customer Data.csv' and 'Healthwell money Claimed Data.csv'. That Contained Detailed information of the customer data and the insurance details of each customer with personal details.

### Tools
- Python-Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing And Data Visualisation
- Ms Excel- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning- Predictive Model

### Data Cleaning/Preprocessing
Using Python Libraries Like Pandas,NuMpY for Data cleaning and preprocessing
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling Missing values
3. Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- What is the average amount of money the company spent on each policy cover?
- Does the gender of the person matter for the company as a constraint for extending policies?
- Can the company extend certain discounts after checking the health status (BMI) in this case?
- Does age have any barrier on the insurance claimed?

### Machine Learning Model 
Builded a machine learning model to predict the amount spent.
Using a linear regression model to predict outcomes in your health insurance dataset and achieving a 72% accuracy rate is impressive. Linear regression is a fundamental yet powerful technique, especially when dealing with predictive modeling.

### Analysis/Findings

The analysis are summarized as follows.
1. From this analysis we found out that gender count doesnot affect the extending of insurance.
2. The most Amount Claimed By the customer have 3 dependants and least have 5 dependants.
3. Most of the Customers are Non-Smokers.
4. Most Of the Customers who have taken are Adults.
5. Most of the insurance policy holders are overweight.

### Recomendations
Based on the analysis,We recommend Following actions.
1. Should Introduce more Policy in Regions where sales is low.
2. Should consider policy for smokers or increase the premium amount.
3. increase premium amount for the over weight people.
